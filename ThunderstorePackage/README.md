# Lethal Company Randomizer

This mod makes (nearly) everything random in the game like:

- Player scales (voice pitch also changes with scale)
- Scrap spawn amount and value randomization (It is possible that only 1 scrap spawns but it's worth 2000 credits, who knows?)
- Player stat randomization (speed, stamina, health)
- Totally random (but not impossible) deadline and quota calculation
- Random item behaviours (Gift boxes have 17 new behaviours to explore, shovels, knives have random damage etc.)
- Full enemy randomization such as speed, health, scale (voice pitch also changes with scale)
- Custom value saving and loading system for randomizable items. Items retain their randomization state even after save load.
- Level objects (landmines, turrets, floor spike traps) now have a random chance to spawn, and a random amount to spawn.
- Landmines are randomly scaled, and have a chance to not explode but instead reward the player with a shotgun.
- Whoopie cushions also have a chance to explode
- And many more, plus more to come!
